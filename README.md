# MTranslation_Urdu_to_Shakespearean

Goal:
Translating Udru poetry to Shakespearean English

Methodology:
Trained Pre-trained models to translate low-resource Urdu language to Modern English (Pivot language). Fine tuned pre-trained GPT for style transfer 
to Shakespearean language.

Reasources:
Used University of Michigan, Ann Abor computing cloud gpu service to train the models. The trained models are here- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nd9KFbgLXVmNgcG5tUmOVOPvLGarNo1V?usp=sharing

Replicate:
To try other Urdu poems or text just download the two trained models from the google drive and the notebook as well on a GPU machine and hit run.

Scope of Improvement:
- The Urdu to English translation model was trained on Bible and Quran Parallel corpus, so the poetic translation can be improved by using 
a databse of Urdu to Modern English or vice-versa poetry.
